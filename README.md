# Bug Report Classification Project

This project aims to classify bug reports into their respective priority labels. The priority labels are defined as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. The classification is done using a machine learning algorithm trained on a dataset of bug reports.

## Methodology
The text classification is done using a supervised learning approach. The text dataset is cleaned and split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning algorithm, and the testing set is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The machine learning algorithm used for this project is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear kernel.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this project:

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for text classification. By accurately classifying bug reports, software developers can prioritize their work and ensure that critical issues are resolved first.
